# Worm-Problem

This program is a demonstration of some different techniques for trying to solve Moser's Worm problem, of which more information can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moser%27s_worm_problem. Due to the inherent intractability of the problem, this is meant to be a baseline for comparison of methods and an exploration of their advantages and weaknesses.

A longer and more detailed writeup can be found in the Writeup.pdf file.
